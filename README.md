# Zenless Zone Zero Mod Generator For 3DMigomoto

ZZZ Mod Generator is a UI tool designed to simplify mod creation for ZZZ developers using the 3DMigomoto mod loader - it was build for simplicity, built to be modular and easily accessible. Yep, you can even mod the modding tool! It's as easy as sticking to the image sizes and just replacing them however you like.

## Download
It's a lot easier than previous versions - this release offers a singular .exe file along with the respective images used to load it. You don't need to install Python or any dependencies as it's all packaged within the exe, just download it from the releases tab, extract the archive to wherever you like and run the .exe, everything *SHOULD* work off the bat!
